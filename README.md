# BMI
Windows form BMI Calculator I call Your BMI Health Journal

While I provided the images of what I made so far here, I'm actually wanting to add more functionality to this project overall so that it actually feels like a very immersive and fully functional app.

The things I want to add to it are the ability to open a file, even a Create File or rather "New". the reason is there's space left over I want to use to display past results: user's name, their weight, their height. I already accounted for Metric and US. I have no idea why the Metric side wants to say higher on the BMI when using kg and m, but it works fine for US. 

So, at this point I'm kind of leaving it as is and hopefully someone with better knowledge than I can come in and make the needed changes, like adding the ability to open file (giving the user the ability to see past results, saving with new results, and they can come back and see their overall journey to get and be healthy), to be able to delete a past entry (if they want to), also add a way to print their results if they want. I can figure out how to E&xit, which is a no-brainer there. 

On Edit be able to cut, copy, or even paste what they need. View I know only has an option to go full screen, and I'm sure I can figure that out. I think. 

Under Tools I'd want to be able to change the Settings on this, be able to move it (it's static at the moment, so wherever it lands on your screen, that's where it resides, unfortunately. Ah, I also need to fix the About "Your BMY Health Journal," I know I'm the primary developer/programmer on this, and I wouldn't mind giving credit to those who help me out as well.

The reason I am trying to build this as fast as possible, I want to raise funds so I can move to be with my fiance. It's a whole new chapter for the both of us. I'd like to be able to have a tech startup. So, that's this appp as far as I can take it -- for now.

EDIT -

I was able to add more functionality: All the radiobuttons do work in my SettingsForm, just not the btnSaveTheme_Click. I'll try and figure that out. 
Other things that work as well - opening a file (if the program can find it), saving a file, printing that file, and of course the exit. Even the upper 
right corner where we typically see the close button, that works too. Edit and those commands, cut, copy, paste and delete do not work at the moment. 
Again, I'll get that fixed as soon as possible. Two other things do not work as well - Open file and Save As. I'll figure it out guys!

If anyone more advanced and knwledgeable in building C# windows apps knows how to fix what I couldn't do on my own - feel free to make the needed changes.
I will give credit where credit is due. And yes, I'd like to be able to get this app to kickstarter to raise much needed funds! I think this might be a 
good app to get into the hands of those like myself, desiring to lose weight and lead healthier lives!
